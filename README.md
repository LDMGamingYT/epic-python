for Python!

# What does it do?
EPIC for Python! adds a lot of *"amazing"* new syntax enforcements, and some *"quirky"* features! *If you have experience with Java, this will be a **little** easier.* It's the worst of both worlds!

# Current Features
- Enforce semicolons
- Block F strings (in favour of `String.format`)
- Replacement of common Python methods to seem more "Java-y"
- Replacement of common Python literals to be more like **EVERY OTHER LANGUAGE**
- Removal of any sanity the developer may have had before using this! (yes, that's a feature)
